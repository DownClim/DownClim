# Introduction

The purpose of `DownClim` is to offer a tool for regional and national
climate projections including the mechanistic 'dynamic' downscaling of
the CORDEX initiative. `DownClim` is opposed to the direct statistical
downscaling of global climate projections found in WorldClim and CHELSA.
`DownClim` is directly inspired of AFRICLIM [@platts2014]. The approach
is justified by an improvement in regional projections of CORDEX
compared to CMIP (insert few references), although it can increase
uncertainty and sometimes be less reliable (insert indian monsoon
reference). The tool is an automated `singularity` workflow easily
reproducible and scalable associated to `singularity` images for enhance
reproducibility and portability.

As a first step we will develop the pipeline for three study countries
(French Guiana, Ivory Coast and New Caledonia) over three continents,
with a single baseline (CHELSA) and a reduced number of global (GCM) and
regional (RCM) climate models for a few scenarios (RCP or SSP). Behind
the choice of countries we have different hypotheses. (1) we expect New
Caledonia regional topography to be important for projections. (2) we
expect Ivory Coast regional climates to be important for projections.
(3) we assume French Guiana to be a control with mainly lowland and
homogeneous climate. To demonstrate the aim of the tool, we want to
validate and/or assess the projections for each country using (1)
projections on observed year (e.g. 2005\>2020, even if the differences
between scenarios will not be significant), and (2) the difference with
forest climatic extent with this product versus classical products.

# Data

## Area

New Caledonia (Australasia) to start with (random choice among the three
but see arguments above).

## Variables

For the moment we will only use monthly temperature (temperature at
surface, tas, °C), and rainfall (total precipitation, tp, m). The idea
is to further compute bioclimatic variables :

> Bioclimatic variables are derived from the monthly temperature and
> rainfall values in order to generate more biologically meaningful
> variables. These are often used in species distribution modeling and
> related ecological modeling techniques. The bioclimatic variables
> represent annual trends (e.g., mean annual temperature, annual
> precipitation) seasonality (e.g., annual range in temperature and
> precipitation) and extreme or limiting environmental factors (e.g.,
> temperature of the coldest and warmest month, and precipitation of the
> wet and dry quarters). A quarter is a period of three months (1/4 of
> the year).

## Baseline

*WorldClim, Chelsa, ERA5-Land, CRU, TAMSAT, CHIRPS, ...*

We will use CHELSA (V2.1, @karger2017 ) for the example with 1-km and
monthly resolutions. Ideally the tool should be built for different
baselines (next steps).

## Climate projections

Depending on temporal resolution of the baseline and the study area
(specifically the continent), we should list available data on CORDEX
regarding:

-   global climate models (GCM)
-   regional climate models (RCM)
-   temporal resolution (monthly for the example)
-   spatial resolution (a priori the finest)
-   scenarios (RCP or SSP, RCP 2.6 & 8.5 for the example)

Available CORDEX experiments are described here:
<http://htmlpreview.github.io/?http://is-enes-data.github.io/CORDEX_status.html>
.

For Australasia (New Caledonia), we have:

-   AUS-22 as the finest domain, e.g. Australasia at 0.22° - 25km
-   4 GCM: ECMWF-ERAINT, MOHC-HadGEM2-ES, MPI-M-MPI-ESM-(LR/MR),
    NCC-NorESM1-M
-   3 RCM: CCLM5-0-15, REMO2015, RegCM4-7
-   2 RCP: RCP 2.6 & RCP 8.5

# Workflow

The workflow is summarised in the draft scheme below.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("dag/DownClim.png")
```

Monthly temperature and precipitation are retrieved for the defined area
for both the baseline and the projections across the historical,
evaluation and projection years. The projections are retrieved for
different global (GCM) and regional (RCM) climatic models with several
scenarios (RCP). Monthly climate is summarised for both the baseline and
the projections across the historical years. For each evaluation and
projection year, monthly climate anomalies of projections compared with
historical means of the projections are computed. For each evaluation
and projection year, the monthly anomalies are interpolated and added to
the historical means of the baseline. For each evaluation year, the
downscaled projections are compared to the baseline. Downscaled
projections evaluation are summarised across evaluation years.
Similarly, downscaled projections are summarised across projection
years. Finally, ensemble of projections & evaluation are made across
global (GCM) and regional (RCM) climatic models while computing across
models uncertainties.

Based on:

-   snakemake
-   singularity
-   GRASS GIS for raster operation and interpolation
-   R ncdf4 (or more appropriate NetCDF tools)
-   rmarkdown for automatic reporting of the pipeline?

# Examples

-   French Guiana, Ivory Coast, New Caledonia
-   Chelsa v2.1 - 1km - monthly
-   All RCM x GCM x RCP available at the finest resolution - monthly

# Assesment

-   predicted vs observed 2005-2023
-   tropical moist forest potential distribution based on CHELSA future
    vs DownClim projections

# Next steps

*To develop once first steps done.*
