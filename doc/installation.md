# Installation

Currently, `DownClim` is under active development and is not yet available on
PyPI or conda. However, you can install it from source by following the
instructions below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DownClim/DownClim.git
cd DownClim
pip install -e .
```

This will install the package in editable mode, so you can make changes to the
source code and see the changes reflected in your environment without having to
reinstall the package.

You can now use `DownClim` in your Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks using:

```python
import downclim
```
